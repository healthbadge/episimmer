# Sample Campus
This example in episimmer shows the user how a college environment can be simulated in epsimmer. In this environment a college can strategize the circumstances in which the college runs. Several policies can be imposed with respect to policies such as the number of days classes are to be conducted, etc. In this example used here, you can see various policies that can be imposed such as monday_online only, monday_wednesday_online. This mostly involves combination of various policy based lockdowns within the campus.
