# Event Lockdown
This example showcases the event based lockdown with Episimmer. Events are lockdown or restricted
from occurring during the simulation. The events attributes are defined in the event files, and we
use them in the policy to decide whether to run the event or not. In the generate_policy file, a simple event
lockdown procedure is implemented by restricting events that are 'Low Priority'.
