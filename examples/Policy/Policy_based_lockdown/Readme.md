# Policy Lockdown 
Episimmer gives the user freedom to implement many kinds of lockdowns. For example, a full lockdown is an enforced policy where all agents are restricted from taking part in any kind of contact with other agents based on a lockdown function. An agent based lockdown is another lockdown policy where specific agents are restricted based on an agent-level attribute. Similarly, Episimmer can restrict agents based on the history of other policies like the Testing policy. Users may also define their own custom lockdown policies using the help of the templates already provided in the examples.

What is flexible and user defined at the moment: 
	i) Full lockdown
	ii) Agent based lockdown - By attribute and by policy history
