# List Of Lists

Episimmer can handle a list of File lists in the config file and run them concurrently. This is to provide the ability to simulate timetable-like simulation environments. For example, Student Timetables for each class are different but the classes are conducted at the same time.

Thus, Events, Interactions and Probabilistic Interactions can pass multiple file_lists in the config file as shown in this example.
