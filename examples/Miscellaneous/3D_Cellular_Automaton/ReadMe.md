# 3D_Cellular_Automaton
This example is built over the Scheduled SEYAR model. 

Here, the interactions between the agents evolve through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring agents. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired and the entire interaction space is constructed eventually.


## Significance of 3D_Cellular_Automaton
The 3D cellular automaton can be said to be a 3D projection of how agents are interacting. 

This is one of the examples that shows that episimmer can react to any amount of complexity, the cellular automaton being the general model of complexity.
