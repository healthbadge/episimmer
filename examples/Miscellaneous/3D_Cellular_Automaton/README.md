# 3D_Cellular_Automaton
This example is built over the Scheduled SEYAR model.

This is a creative example of modelling interactions between the agents as a cellular automaton. For a nice visualization of the interactions, use the view_interaction_graph pythonn file in the Scripts/Visualization directory.


## Additional Information

This is one of the examples that shows that episimmer can model any amount of complexity with respect to contacts among agents.
