# Scheduled_SIR_External_Prevalence
This example builds over the basic Scheduled SIR model by introducing the concept of external prevalence. 


## Significance of Scheduled_SIR_External_Prevalence
Disease spread is contained using policies and restrictions that are enforced by the government or university management. However, it is not certain that all agents will comply with the enforced rules and standards.

Episimmer uses this example to study disease transmission involving such exceptions, i.e., creates simulations which are influenced by scenarios such as agents not following lockdown norms, not getting vaccinated, not getting tested, etc.
