# Bandit_Algos_Agent_Vulnerability
An example of finding Agent vulnerabilities in the system. We first select an agent based on either epsilon greedy or the UCB1 algorithm, remove him from the environment and run the simulation.

The selection process for removal of agents is done in one of the two ways -

1. Epsilon Greedy Selection

    Random selection of agent done with probability $\epsilon$ and greedy (highest scoring agent) selection of agent with probability
    $1 - \epsilon$.

2. UCB1

    Selection of agent based on equation -
    $\arg \max_{a} ( running\ avg\ score_{a} + \sqrt{\frac{2 \log{t}}{N_t(a)}})$
    where $a$ represents an agent and $N_t(a)$ represents the number of times agent $a$ has been selected for removal.

The score of the agent is based on the severity of outbreak after the agent's removal.

The agent score is calculated by finding the running average of scores for each run. The score for a given run i is given by -

$Agent\ Score_i = 1 - (Total\ Agents\ Infected) / (Total\ Agents)$

This process is run multiple times.
