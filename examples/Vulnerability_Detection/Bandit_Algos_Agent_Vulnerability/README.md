# Bandit_Algos_Agent_Vulnerability
An example of finding Agent vulnerabilities in the system. We first select an agent for removal based on either epsilon greedy or the UCB1 algorithm, then we run the simulation.

***I) Agent Selection***

**Epsilon Greedy**

Random selection of agent done with probability &epsilon; and greedy (highest scoring agent) selection of agent with probability
1 - &epsilon;.

**UCB1**

Selection of agent based on equation -

where *a* represents an agent and *N<sub>t</sub>(a)* represents the number of times agent *a* has been selected for removal.

***II) Agent Score***

After removal, the simulation is run to get the score of the removed agent. Score of the agent is based on the severity of outbreak after the agent's removal.

The agent score is calculated by finding the running average of scores for each run. The score for a single run is given by -
