# Chunk_Agent_Vulnerability
An example of finding Agent vulnerabilities in the system. We first randomly select an agent, remove him from the environment
and run the simulation. For higher stability, chunks of the entire simulation are considered instead of the entire simulation. The score of the agent is based on the severity of outbreak after the agent's removal.

The agent score is given by -

where &beta; is a randomly generated integer based on the user defined parameters for chunk length, and
&gamma; = &beta; + chunk length - 1.
