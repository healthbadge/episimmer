# Vulnerability Detection
Vulnerabilities in Episimmer refers to the weakest links in the simulation environment. These vulnerabilities can arise from agents, locations, events and interactions. We shall specifically focus on agent based vulnerabilities.

Agent based vulnerabilities can be broadly classified into two groups :
1. Vulnerable agents : Agents who are most likely to reach a certain disease state. For example ‘agents most likely to die’  or ‘agents most likely to get infected’ or ‘agents most likely to be hospitalised’.

2. Agent vulnerability : Agents on removal or constrained for a duration of time from the ecosystem, lead to the largest reduction in risk or size of the epidemic. This is an optimization problem using a cost function that can encode priorities.


## Running
To run an example :

		cd examples/Policy
		python ../../src/Main.py Stochastic_SIR_VD1 -vul
