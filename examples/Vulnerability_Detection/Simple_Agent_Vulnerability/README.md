# Simple_Agent_Vulnerability
An example of finding Agent vulnerabilities in the system. We first randomly select an agent, remove him from the environment
and run the simulation. The score of the agent is based on the severity of outbreak after the agent's removal.

The agent score is calculated by finding the running average of scores for each run. The score for a given run i is given by -

$Agent\ Score_i = 1 - (Total\ Agents\ Infected) / (Total\ Agents)$

This process is run multiple times.
