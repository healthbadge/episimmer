# Early_Vulnerable_Agents
An example of finding Vulnerable agents in the system. We run the simulation multiple times and score the agent based on the number of times he was infected and also given a higher score if he was infected earlier.

The agent score is given by -

$Agent\ Score = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(Total\ Timesteps - Timestep\ Infected)$

if the agent was infected, else 0.
