# Vulnerability Detection
Vulnerabilities can be classified as the weakest links in the ecosystem that on removal improve the epidemic situation and reduce risk of further spread. These vulnerabilities can arise from agents, locations, events and interactions. This can be viewed as disconnecting parts of the system to stop spread of a disease. We shall specifically focus on agent based vulnerabilities.

Agent based vulnerabilities can be broadly classified into two groups
Vulnerable agents : Agents who are most likely to reach a certain disease state. For example ‘agents most likely to die’  or ‘agents most likely to get infected’ or ‘agents most likely to be hospitalised’. 
Agent vulnerability : Agents on removal or constrained for a duration of time from the ecosystem, lead to the largest reduction in risk or size of the epidemic. This is an optimization problem using a cost function that can encode priorities.
