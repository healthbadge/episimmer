# Scheduled_SEYAR
This example has been built by introducing two additional states to the Scheduled SIR disease model- "Asymptomatic" and "Symptomatic".

It includes one event where the agents either contribute to or receive from ambient infection.


## Additional Information
This is a basic example which is used as a baseline for building more complex Scheduled models by introducing complexity in events, interactions, policies and restrictions.

This example helps in showing disease spread through an event where all agents interact with each other, and where transition from one state to another, for a population, may be symmetric about a mean. This is important for scenarios in which the population under consideration collectively shows a state transition that averages to a mean with some deviation. For custom distributions, please refer to the Miscellaneous examples directory.
