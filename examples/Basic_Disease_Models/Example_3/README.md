# Example_3
This example is a remodelling of Example_1 which uses a Scheduled model comprising of the states- Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Symptomatic and Recovered (Scheduled SEYAR).

Here, the interactions have been broadly classified as weekday interactions and weekend interactions.


## Additional Information
This example helps to gauge the disease transmission by generalising contacts over the weekdays and weekends.

Users who do not have valid data about the interactions and events taking place every single day throughout the week may use this example to get an approximate idea about infection spread.
