# Example_3
This example is a remodelling of Example_1 which uses a Scheduled model comprising of the states- Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Symptomatic and Recovered (Scheduled SEYAR).

Here, the interactions have been broadly classified as weekday interactions and weekend interactions.


## Significance of Example_3
This example helps to guage the disease transmission (influenced by time of contact) as generalised over the weekdays and weekends. 

Users who do not have valid data about the interactions and events taking place every single day throughout the week may use this example to get an approximate idea about infection spread. 


## Running Example_3
To run code from current directory :

		cd examples/Basic_Disease_Models
		python ../src/Main.py Example_3
