# Basic_Disease_Models
The examples in this directory shows the basic models that the user can implement. Episimmer currently provides two kinds of disease models namely, Stochastic and Scheduled models. Both these modelling types are variants of the well known [Compartmental Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) that exist today. Some of them implemented here are the SIR, SEYAR, SIRID models. For further details on these models refer to [Tutorial 2.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vn8xc95bCQ7K09lMuc3ijHfSeDPa6Nd28tko-19SlnQ/edit?usp=sharing).
