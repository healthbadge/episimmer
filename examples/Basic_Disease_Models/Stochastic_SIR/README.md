# Stochastic_SIR
This example has been built using the Stochastic Model consisting of three states Susceptible, Infected and Recovered.

The agents are allowed to interact in an event at a location where they can contribute to or receive from an ambient infection.

As output, it plots a graph that helps us visualize disease spread over a specified number of time steps and a specified number of worlds.<br>


## Additional Information
Episimmer has used this example as a fundamental Stochastic model which uses the SIR compartmentalised representation.
