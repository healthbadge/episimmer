# Example_1
This example uses the Stochastic model comprising of the states- Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Symptomatic and Recovered.

It represents a university environment where the agents like students, teachers, visitors, etc. receive or contribute to infection through interactions and events laid out across different campus locations.

Interactions as well as events have been defined for the weekdays and weekends from Monday through Sunday.



Episimmer uses this example to study disease spread using a real-life scenario (university).

The specificity of this example comes from defining interactions between agents as well as the events that each agent was part of for every single day throughout the week.

It shows how the probability of getting infected by a single interaction is also dependent on additional parameters such as time of contact and intensity of interaction (these parameters are passed by the user). This is how infection spread can be influenced by introducing factors that are characteristic to the way the agents of the population interact with one another.

This introduces more flexibily in terms of implementation and the university can use this opportunity to make better decisions in the fight against COVID or any other disease/infection breakout.
