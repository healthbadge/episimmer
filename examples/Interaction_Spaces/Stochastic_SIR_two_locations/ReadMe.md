# Stochastic_SIR_two_locations
This example uses the Stochastic SIR model to show infection spread using events at two locations.


## Significance of Stochastic_SIR_two_locations
This example demonstrates how events taking place in multiple locations can influence reception and contribution to ambient infection. 

The different locations may have multiple events taking place in them simultaneously. The user has the liberty to make choices wrt this.
