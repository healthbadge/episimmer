# Scheduled_SEYAR_Interactions
This example builds over the Scheduled SEYAR model. It uses interactions, which is a construct in Episimmeer to define contact between two agents, to influence the transmission of disease between states.

The interactions are unidirectional, hence we have to specify two interactions to depict bidirectional contact between any two agents.


## interactions_list.txt
Contains the number of interactions followed by the interactions themselves specified as:
        Agent: Interacting Agent


## Running Scheduled_SEYAR_Interactions
