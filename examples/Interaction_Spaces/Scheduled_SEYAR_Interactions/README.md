# Scheduled_SEYAR_Interactions
This example builds over the Scheduled SEYAR model. It uses interaction constructs in Episimmer to define contact between two agents, to influence the transmission of disease between states.

The file interactions_list.txt contains all the interactions between the agents.


## Additional Information
The interactions are unidirectional, hence we have to specify two interactions to depict bidirectional contact between any two agents.
