# Two_events_alternating_with_intersection
This example is a variation of the model Stochastic_SIR_two_events_alternating. Instead of having two alternating events in which neither of the two events have common agents with the other, we are introducing a model in which the alternating events may have a few agents in common to both of them.

This example has been introduced to deal with situations where an infected agent may belong to more than one event as in that case, we must consider disease spread by the agent wrt both the events.
