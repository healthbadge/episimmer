# Two_events_alternating_with_intersection
This example is a variation of the model Stochastic_SIR_two_events_alternating. Instead of having two alternating events in which neither of the two events have common agents with the other, we are introducing a model in which the alternating events may have a few agents in common to both of them.

This example has been introduced to deal with situations where an infected agent may belong to more than one event.
