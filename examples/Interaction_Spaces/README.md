# Interaction Spaces
The examples covered under this sub-directory cover clear cut examples of Episimmer's flexibility on how agents can interact with each other in the simulation environment.

Currently, Episimmer can model the following modules for agent interactions :

1. Interactions (Simple one-to-one agent contact)
2. Events (Complete graph of interactions)
3. One time event
4. Probabilistic Interactions

**To run an example :**

		cd examples/Interaction_Spaces
		python ../../episimmer/main.py Two_events_alternating_with_intersection
