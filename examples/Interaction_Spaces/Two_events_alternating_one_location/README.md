# Two_events_alternating_one_location
This example involves alternating events in a single location.

It is one of the different variations of real-life scenarios involving events and locations where these events occur.


Episimmer uses this example to highlight the cyclicity of events and how they are cyclicly called in some particular order. This is demonstrated by introducing two events in the event_files_list.txt file.

Such examples can be used to simulate university scenarios where there are for instance two classes being held in the same lecture hall on alternate days.

The user has the liberty decide whether these events occur in the same location or not.
