Getting Started
=====================================

The best method to read this documentation is to go through them sequentially. This tutorial is designed
such that the core componnents of Episimmer are described first and then the more intricate ones. It would also help to go through the
external references for a much better understanding of Epidemic Simulations and thus Episimmer.


You may also go through these colab notebooks for a more hands-on tutorial on Episimmer:
